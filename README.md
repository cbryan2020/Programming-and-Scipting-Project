Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariant data set that details the length and width (in centimetres) of the sepals and petals of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).  The dataset was used by British biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper titled “the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of discriminant analysis. This paper argues that using just a single feature of a plant to distinguish between plant species is insufficient. Fisher argues that using multiple characteristics that generate a more comprehensive feature is more effective. Here, it was demonstrated that measuring the length and width of the Iris flower sepal and petal could effectively distinguish between the three species. 

The rationale behind Fisher’s argument is relevant today. Multivariant analysis (i.e. the use of multiple variable in an analysis) is commonplace in data science to identify patterns and relationships. The paper highlights the need to identify what features are relevant. In his paper, Fisher selects variables that can distinguish between groups. This is relevant today. Analysing a combination of variables is crucial for improving the resolution of an analysis. Multiple variable must often be used to accurately differentiate between groups. For example, the more data obtained on a groups political opinions, the more accurately voting patterns can be predicted.
